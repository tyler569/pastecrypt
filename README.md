# README

Theoretically all you need to do to get started as far as I know:

- `sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev zlibs1-dev`
- `gem install rails` or `gem install --user-install rails`
- `git clone <this repo>`
- `cd pastecrypt`
- `bundle install` or `bundle install --path vendor/bundle`
- `rake db:schema:load`
- `rails server`
